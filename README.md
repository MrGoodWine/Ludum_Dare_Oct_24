Get ready for a wild 4-player competition in **Super Bug Bash**, where you and your bug friends race to gather the most pollen before time runs out. But watch out – your opponents will bash you into thorny vines, causing you to drop your pollen, and they’ll be quick to swoop in and snatch it! With the lead changing in an instant, every second counts.

Choose your favorite cute bug: the agile **Ladybug**, the sneaky **Aphid**, the hardworking **Ant**, or the glowing **Firefly**. Challenge your friends in a fast-paced race to victory, whether you’re playing on an emulator or using real SNES hardware with a flash cart and multitap. 

**Super Bug Bash** captures the spirit of competitive fun with simple but challenging mechanics and plenty of chaotic moments where the game can turn on its head at any time.
